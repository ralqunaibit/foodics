* Docker Deployment

This readme provides instructions on how to build and run a Docker container locally for a Dockerized application. Note that this website was an old project I worked on almsot 10 years ago. So I thought of reusing it for the docker part of this assignment.

* Prerequisites

Before running the Docker container, ensure you have the following prerequisites installed:

- **Docker**: v19.03 or higher

* Directory Structure

The project directory is organized as follows:

#+begin_example
foodics/
└── app/
   ├── Dockerfile
   └── (website files)
#+end_example
* Building and Running the Docker Container

** 1. Build the Docker Image

Navigate to the `app` directory and build the Docker image:

#+begin_src bash
cd app
docker build -t your_dockerhub_username/your_image_name:latest .
#+end_src

** 2. Run the Docker Container

Run the Docker container from the image you just built:

#+begin_src bash
docker run -d -p 80:80 --name your_container_name your_dockerhub_username/your_image_name:latest
#+end_src

* Accessing the Application

After running the Docker container, you can access the application in your browser at:

#+begin_example
http://localhost:80
#+end_example

* Stopping and Removing the Docker Container

** 1. Stop the Docker Container

Stop the running Docker container:

#+begin_src bash
docker stop your_container_name
#+end_src

** 2. Remove the Docker Container

Remove the stopped Docker container:

#+begin_src bash
docker rm your_container_name
#+end_src

* Pushing the Docker Image to Docker Hub

** 1. Log in to Docker Hub

Log in to your Docker Hub account:

#+begin_src bash
docker login
#+end_src

** 2. Tag the Docker Image

Tag the Docker image for pushing to Docker Hub:

#+begin_src bash
docker tag your_dockerhub_username/your_image_name:latest your_dockerhub_username/your_image_name:latest
#+end_src

** 3. Push the Docker Image

Push the Docker image to Docker Hub:

#+begin_src bash
docker push your_dockerhub_username/your_image_name:latest
#+end_src

* Troubleshooting

- **Port Conflict**: Ensure port 80 is not in use by another application.
- **Docker Daemon Not Running**: Ensure the Docker daemon is running.

For further issues, check the Docker logs:

#+begin_src bash
docker logs your_container_name
#+end_src
